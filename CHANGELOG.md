# 0.1.0

- Initial Version w/ several code rewrites that are not documented here.

# 0.2.0

- Rewritten version with again several major code rewrites that have been done before this SVN began.

# 0.3.0

- The search dialog for the currently opened document now does not close on Enter but enables you to repeatedly press `Enter` instead of `Cmd/Ctrl-G` to `findNext`
- Added several shortcuts for comfortable editing: `Cmd/Ctrl-B` boldens a selected text (or inserts bold-markers at cursor position). Accordingly, `Cmd/Ctrl-I` emphasizes, `Cmd/Ctrl-K` converts the selection into a link and `Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-I` inserts an image.
- Added support for HTML, DOCX, ODT and PDF export using Pandoc and LaTeX

# 0.4.0

- Color theme unified (now less colors, more consistency)
- More generally, adaptions in design
- Included directories into preview list pane to mark where directories begin and end
- Now files and directories are automatically sorted, whenever a new gets added
- Renaming of files and directories is possible now.
- Moving of directories via drag'n'drop is now possible.
- Dark Theme configuration stays also after quit and restart.

# 0.5.0

- Improved drag and drop of directories
- Moving files now works via drag'n'drop as well
- Fixed a bug that led to undefined errors while trying to rename directories
- Much cleaner arrow-key navigation through the preview pane — now failsafe.

- Global search is now non-blocking and provides a progress indicator
- Now Shift-click on URLs opens these in external browser.

# 0.5.1

- Fixed a bug that disabled the creation of new directories and instead threw errors
- Fixed an error that was thrown by pandoc on each PDF export.

# 0.6.0

- Now the file lists are automatically sorted on renaming files to immediately reflect a possibly changed order.
- The global search now also includes the name of the file
- Fixed a small error that prevented Zettlr from searching the first file in the preview pane
- Fixed an error in the inter-process communication (IPC) that led to unexpected behavior when using Shortcuts.
- Fixed an error that prevented renaming of directories if a file was selected.
- And behind the scene: We've rewritten the whole code base and made it more efficient — that's why the version has switched to 0.6.0
