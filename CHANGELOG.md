# 0.1.0

- Initial Version w/ several code rewrites that are not documented here.

# 0.2.0

- Rewritten version with again several major code rewrites that have been done before this SVN began.

# 0.3.0

- The search dialog for the currently opened document now does not close on Enter but enables you to repeatedly press `Enter` instead of `Cmd/Ctrl-G` to `findNext`
- Added several shortcuts for comfortable editing: `Cmd/Ctrl-B` boldens a selected text (or inserts bold-markers at cursor position). Accordingly, `Cmd/Ctrl-I` emphasizes, `Cmd/Ctrl-K` converts the selection into a link and `Cmd/Ctrl-Shift-I` inserts an image.
- Added support for HTML, DOCX, ODT and PDF export using Pandoc and LaTeX

# 0.4.0

- Color theme unified (now less colors, more consistency)
- More generally, adaptions in design
- Included directories into preview list pane to mark where directories begin and end
- Now files and directories are automatically sorted, whenever a new gets added
- Renaming of files and directories is possible now.
- Moving of directories via drag'n'drop is now possible.
- Dark Theme configuration stays also after quit and restart.
- Minor bug fixes and improvements (especially failsafes)
- Context menu
- Auto closing of brackets and quotes

# 0.5.0

- Improved drag and drop of directories
- Moving files now works via drag'n'drop as well
- Fixed a bug that led to undefined errors while trying to rename directories
- Much cleaner arrow-key navigation through the preview pane — now failsafe.
- Now you can navigate to top or bottom in the preview list by holding Cmd or Ctrl while pressing the arrow key.
- Global search is now non-blocking and provides a progress indicator
- Now Shift-click on URLs opens these in external browser.
- Implemented preferences.

# 0.5.1

- Fixed a bug that disabled the creation of new directories and instead threw errors
- Fixed an error that was thrown by pandoc on each PDF export.

# 0.6.0

- Now the file lists are automatically sorted on renaming files to immediately reflect a possibly changed order.
- The global search now also includes the name of the file
- Fixed a small error that prevented Zettlr from searching the first file in the preview pane
- Fixed an error in the inter-process communication (IPC) that led to unexpected behavior when using Shortcuts.
- Fixed an error that prevented renaming of directories if a file was selected.
- And behind the scene: We've rewritten the whole code base and made it more efficient — that's why the version has switched to 0.6.0

# 0.7.0

- Included Spellchecking (en_US, en_GB, fr_FR, de_DE, more languages on request)
- Translated app into English, German and French.
- Introducing **Quicklook**: Right-click on any note and click "Quicklook" to open the file in a small overlay window. This enables you to keep open a file while simultaneously reading (and copying text) from different files.
- Fixed a minor error with the detection of clickable links
- Fixed an error that prevented searching for exact phrases
- Added a short check that Zettlr does not try to move a directory into a subdirectory.
- Multiple minor fixes and improvements
- Preview pane and directory tree view can now be hidden via `Cmd/Ctrl+1` and `Cmd/Ctrl+2`

# 0.8.0

## GUI and functionality

- Context menu over a erroneous word now gives you suggestions on possible replacements; selecting them will replace the word.
- Fixed a small rendering bug that caused the editor not to correctly select text after hide/unhide of either the tree view or file preview pane.
- Included a toolbar and moved the global search out of the preview pane
- Fixed a small bug in which the title of the main window still showed the title of the currently opened file after it has been deleted
- Fixed a bug that made it impossible to export to PDF on Windows when Zettlr was installed to the `Program Files`-directory
- Fixed a bug that did not close the overlay if there were no dictionaries selected for spell checking
- Finally implemented the make/unmake itemized or numbered list function
- Also, finally added an easy way to insert and remove footnotes.
- - Fixed an error in which you could not save "empty" files on the fly if you just started typing into the editor without any file open.

## Under the hood (i.e.: technical stuff)

- Replaced npm package `trash` with electron internal `shell.moveItemToTrash()`
- Hardened the translation package against potential errors and accounted for also probably missing translations
