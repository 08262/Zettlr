# Contributing to Zettlr

Hey there.

First of all: Thanks for wanting to contribute. Anyone can contribute, no matter if you can actually code or just complain about unwanted behavior. Everything helps this app to grow better for anybody.

I have no special requirements on how to commit to Zettlr yet. But some basic expectations I have about contributing (to both safe time for me and you) will be listed below:

* If you found a bug, please open up an issue. Don't want to create a GitHub-Account for that? No problem, just email me at zettlr@mailbox.org and I'll open up the issue myself.
* If you think some feature is behaving not as you would expect, please do the same (e.g., if you do not want to create a GitHub account first, email me!)
* If a feature you'd like to use is missing, the same applies!

## Contributing code

After all, I'm very thankful for every piece of code I do not have to write on my own. So if you decide to add a feature on your own using forks and pull requests, please commit to the develop branch. Then I'll merge them as soon as possible and commit them to master. And please respect that I want to do the code rewrite (the code base is currently a mess, as you might see by yourselves) on my own.

## Anything else?

If there's anything else, you can use eiher GitHub or mail to contact me directly. If you think something is missing, please contact me! I don't bite :)
